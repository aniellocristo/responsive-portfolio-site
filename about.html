        <h3>About</h3>
        <p>I was always interested in web design and programming. In 2007 I began a journey to learn web development. Some time after this my journey was cut short by the increasing workload related to my college courses. I went on to earn my Bachelors of Science in Architecture in 2012, and the years that followed I worked in architectural design and project management.</p>

        <p>Through those years I always found my attention re-directing to web development and at the end of 2015 I decided it was time to restart my journey. Much has changed since then. Flash is a thing of the past, HTML 5 and CSS 3 took over from HTML 4 and CSS2, and a plethora of other languages have become common place. I would soon learn what I wanted to become was a Full Stack Developer. This is where I am today, fully immersing myself in design and development.</p>
